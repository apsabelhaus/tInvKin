## Core tiso libraries

This folder organized as:

- 2d: core library functions for the 2d inverse statics optimization
- 3d: core library functions for the 3d inverse statics optimization
- helper: Functions that apply to *both* the 2d and 3d case. For example, the optimization weights, parsers and data loggers, and matrices that are calculated in either dimension in the same way (ex., bar removal matrix H.)

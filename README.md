# tInvKin
tInvKin (Tensegrity Inverse Kinematics) is collection of libraries and functions that perform inverse kinematics procedures on tensegrity structures and robots.

NOTE that this repository is under active development and is NOT ready to use. Many calculations may have errors (either conceptual or software bugs) and the algorithms may only apply to specific types of tensegrity robots as of yet.

The expected release date of v0.1 of this library is late spring or summer 2019.

# tiso
tiso (Tensegrity Inverse Statics Optimization) is collection of libraries and functions that solve inverse statics problems for tensegrity structures and robots.

NOTE that this repository is under active development and is NOT ready to use. The software has yet to be verified for most cases.

The expected release date of v0.1 of this library is late fall 2019 or spring 2019.

% one used for the spring/summer 2019 data collection.

% The 'trajectory' script here outputs a sequence of equilibrium rest
% length solutions, for use with control.

% Spring constant for the cables. This isn't used in the optimization for
% force (densities) itself, but for conversion into inputs when saving the
% data.
% Here's how to specify 'the same spring constant for all cables'. In N/m.
% For the hardware test, the Jones Spring Co. #241 has a constant of 1.54
% lb/in, which is 270 N/m.
% One set of new McMaster springs is 4.79 lb/in,
% conversion is 
lbin_in_nm = 175.126835;
kappa_i = 4.79 * lbin_in_nm;
% ...which happens to be
%kappa_i = 270;
kappa = ones(s,1) * kappa_i;
% On 2018-12-6, we changed cable 3 and 4 to have a higher spring constant, so it
% has less extension, since we were running into hardware limitations.
%kappa(3) = 8.61 * lbin_in_nm;
% with the 25 lb/in spring:
kappa(3) = 25.4 * lbin_in_nm;
kappa(4) = 25.4 * lbin_in_nm;
%kappa(4) = 8.61 * lbin_in_nm;


% Some dimensions of the springs.
% We need to check for collisions / add this to the formulation as a
% constraint.

% The following are all in meters.

% The initial lengths of each of the springs used, from the manufactuter,
% listed here according to their spring constants.
% NOTE that this is TIP-TO-TIP: put the whole spring in the calipers and
% you get this number. This is *NOT* center to center.
l_init_8 = 1 * 2.54 * 0.01;
l_init_4 = 1 * 2.54 * 0.01;
l_init_25 = 0.75 * 2.54 * 0.01;

% The spring extender length (which is added to spring initial length) is 
% 1 inch CENTER TO CENTER of the loops, but the spring hooks to the end of 
% the outer loop, and it's 0.13 inch from center to inside of the
% extender's hook, so total from node (center on one end) to spring tip is
% 1.13 inch. HOWEVER, since the spring is curved, the tip doesn't sit
% exactly at the edge. That extra delta is 1.1 mm (0.0011 m), subtracted
% away.
extender_length = 1.13 * 2.54 * 0.01 - (0.0011);

% We also need to account for the screw tensioner mechanism.
% There are two in use here:
% one with a single screw point, and 
% one with two screws (one spring, one cable.)

% For both of these, we'll make the following assumption:
% Screw is held against edge of spring hook,
% cable is tightened against screw from the other side.
% So, for the single-screw tensioner, we're just looking at the diameter of
% the screw which needs to be subtracted from spring. We have M3 screws.
% If need more precision later: include thickness of spring wire.
tensioner_single_length = 0.003;

% For the single-screw tensioner, the spring tip is its center, 
% adding an extra few mm from its center to edge. Measured roughly (cm -> m)
% TO-DO: adjust this more if we get noisy data. Account for screw diameter,
% use that instead, since the cable is really looped around the screw, then
% also in addition account for the offset from center (edge??) of spring
% loop.
% adjuster_length = 0.36 * 0.01;
% tensioner_single_length = 0.36 * 0.01;

% For the double-screw tensioner, 
% center-to-center of the two screws SHOULD be 9mm, but Drew measured 1 cm.
% minus the radius of the screw on each side equals a full diameter (3mm), 
% so inside-edge of screw to inside-edge is
tensioner_double_length = 0.007;

%initial_lengths = [l_init_4; l_init_4; l_init_8; l_init_4];

% The "initial lengths" here are then total distance from node center to
% connection point of cable.
% Cables 1 and 2 (top and bottom) use the 4 lb/in springs, and cables 3 and
% 4 (saddles) use the 25 lb/in spring.
% Also, 1,2 use double extenders, 3,4 use single extenders.
initial_lengths = [l_init_4 + extender_length + tensioner_double_length; 
                   l_init_4 + extender_length + tensioner_double_length; 
                   l_init_25 + extender_length + tensioner_single_length;
                   l_init_25 + extender_length + tensioner_single_length];

% So, the total length to subtract from the rest length is
% init_len_offset = initial_lengths + extender_length;
% ...now included in "initial_lengths."
init_len_offset = initial_lengths;

% Example of how to do the 'anchored' analysis.
% Declare a vector w \in R^n, 
% where w(i) == 1 if the node should be 'kept'.
% For this example, want to treat body 1 as the anchored nodes.
% So, we zero-out anchored nodes 1 through 3, and keep nodes 4-7
% (which is the free vertebra.)
w = [0; 0; 0; 1; 1; 1; 1];
% Including all nodes:
%w = ones(n,1);

% IMPORTANT! If chosing to remove nodes, must change 'b' also, or else inv
% kin will FAIL.

% We also need to declare which nodes are pinned (with external reaction
% forces) and which are not.
% We're choosing not to have this be the same as w, since there are some
% nodes to "ignore" for w which are not necessarily built in to the ground
% for "pinned". Example, nodes inside the anchored triangle of points,
% maybe we don't want the node C to be pinned, just A and B.

% ^ 2019-05-13: this does NOT matter anymore, since we ignore the anchored
% points in our analysis, and since we're not even calculating external
% reaction forces anymore.

% So, only nodes 1 and 2 are pinned.
pinned = zeros(n,1);
pinned(1) = 1;
pinned(2) = 1;

%% Trajectory of positions

% all the positions of each rigid body (expressed as their COM positions
% and rotation). that's 3 states: [x; y; \gamma] with
% the angle being an intrinsic rotation.

% We need the initial pose of the robot, PI_0, at which the cables are
% calibrated. This is for the hardware test: at pose PI_0, the cables are
% assumed to be at "perfectly 0 force", e.g. just barely not slack. For
% example, if we fix the spine at some position, and adjust each cable so
% it's just barely no longer slack, then we have a calibration.

% For calculations with the hardware test setup, we need to know
% where the vertebra is pinned into place for calibration. This is
% currently (as of 2019-05-13) where the dowel pins align ("d1" in free
% frame and "E" in fixed frame.) This is because the zero of the free frame
% is at the geometric center, now.

calibrated_position_free_x = E_x - d_1;
calibrated_position_free_y = E_y;
calibrated_position_free = [calibrated_position_free_x;
                            calibrated_position_free_y;
                            0];

% (as of 2018-12-10) at:
% calibrated_position_free = [bar_endpoint; 0; 0];
% ...because the center of that frame is at bar_endpoint, not the CoM, and
% the robot is assumed to have zero rotation at its initial state.

% The "fixed" vertebra, the leftmost one, has no translation or rotation.
% To get the full system state, we must specify both.
% calibrated_position_fixed = [0; 0; 0];

% 2019-05-13: easier to just say the global frame for fixed.
coordinates_calibrated_anchors = a_fixed;

% We can then get the positions of each of the nodes. We need this for the
% initial length calculations. It's important to note that we need it for
% BOTH of these two vertebrae, which have different frames.
% coordinates_calibrated_fixed = get_node_coordinates_2d(a_fixed, ...
%     calibrated_position_fixed, debugging);

% and for the free vertebra
coordinates_calibrated_free = get_node_coordinates_2d(a_free, ...
    calibrated_position_free, debugging);

% We can then use the same trick from the invkin_core function to calculate
% the lengths of the cables, via the C matrix. Concatenate the node
% positions for the whole structure:
coordinates_calibrated_x = zeros(n,1);
coordinates_calibrated_y = zeros(n,1);
% The outputs from get_node_coordinates are row vectors:
coordinates_calibrated_x(1:3) = coordinates_calibrated_anchors(1,:)';
coordinates_calibrated_x(4:7) = coordinates_calibrated_free(1,:)';
coordinates_calibrated_y(1:3) = coordinates_calibrated_anchors(2,:)';
coordinates_calibrated_y(4:7) = coordinates_calibrated_free(2,:)';
% The lengths of each cable member in the two directions are (via the 
% "cable" rows of C),
dx0 = C(1:4,:) * coordinates_calibrated_x;
dy0 = C(1:4,:) * coordinates_calibrated_y;
% so the lengths of each cable are the euclidean norm of each 2-vector,
% re-organize:
D0 = [dx0, dy0];
% the row norm here is then the length.
lengths_0 = vecnorm(D0, 2, 2);

% Now, for the trajectory as the robot moves:
% The trajectory generation function gives back a sequence of states for
% which we require cable inputs.
% Let's do a trajectory that sweeps from 0 to pi/8.
%max_sweep = pi/8;
%max_sweep = pi/12;
max_sweep = pi/16;
% To swing the vertebra down slowly, do a sweep to a negative number.
%max_sweep = -pi/16;
% Now, also include a minimum. This was 0 before. Now, we can start "down"
% somewhere and bend upward.
min_sweep = -pi/16;
%min_sweep = 0;

% The frames are at an initial configuration of zero rotation.
rotation_0 = 0;

% and translated outward. The test setup's default position has the free
% vertebra directly aligned with the saddle cables' eyebolt exit points,
% which, since the moving vertebra has its frame origin at the geometric
% center,
% translation_0 = [bar_endpoint; 0];
% For testing, here's a smaller fraction.
% translation_0 = [bar_endpoint * (3/4); 0];

% 2019-05-13: With the new coordinate frame, let's move the vertebra back
% by half the length from its origin to the back nodes, keeping its
% y-position the same. That width dimension is "width", so 
translation_0 = [calibrated_position_free_x - width/2;
                 calibrated_position_free_y];

% A good sweep 


%we don't want it to sweep out from the tip of the
% eyebolts, but instead from whatever the "center" of the fixed vertebra
% eyebolt pattern would be.
% That's maybe halfway between the tip and the back, or
rot_axis_pt = [back_x*(2/3); 0];

% get the trajectory:
[xi_all] = trajectory_XZT_bend_2d(translation_0, rotation_0, min_sweep, ...

%xi = zeros(b * 3, 1);

% for rigid body 1, the fixed one, doesn't move. However, we've defined it

% the y-axis so the saddle cables can align. Let's rotate it clockwise so
% that node 4 is in +x.
% xi(3) = -pi/2;

% for rigid body 2, translate out in the +x direction. Translating by one
% full body length puts the tips exactly in the same plane, so maybe do it
% to 3/4 of that length.
% the length of one vert is 2 * bar_endpoint. 
% x-position is coordinate 1.
% To make things interesting, let's rotate it a small bit, too.

% % Now, we have to adjust by the offsets in position, since the total length
% % changes. First, the difference between the calibrated position and the
% % initial equilibrium state will be needed to be subtracted away.
% % The length calculation for the calibrated position can be done as
% 
% % The locations of each of the nodes for the moving vertebra:
% calibrated_nodes_free = a_free + calibrated_position;
% calibrated_nodes_fixed = a_fixed;
% calibrated_nodes_x(1:4, i) = calibrated_nodes_fixed(1,:)';
% calibrated_nodes_x(5:8, i) = calibrated_nodes_free(1,:)';
% calibrated_nodes_y(1:4, i) = calibrated_nodes_fixed(2,:)';
% calibrated_nodes_y(5:8, i) = calibrated_nodes_free(2,:)';
% %H_hat = [eye(s), zeros(s, r)];
% % all the lengths of each cable are:
% dx0 = C(1:4,:) * calibrated_nodes_x;
% dz0 = C(1:4,:) * calibrated_nodes_y;
% 
% % so the lengths of each cable are the euclidean norm of each 2-vector.
% % re-organize:
% D0 = [dx0, dz0];

% % the scalar lengths are then the 2-norm (euclidean) for each column, which
% % is
% % lengths_0 = vecnorm(D0, 2, 2);
% % the difference that needs to be added is this amount minus current
% % length.
% % in cm:
% lengths_adj = (lengths_0 - lengths)*100;
% 
% % the stretches then will be adjusted by this amount. Needs to be additive.
% stretch_opt = stretch_opt + lengths_adj;

% A quick plot of the changes in cable lengths.
